# Sumsub — Analyze Regulation

Reads a regulation document and produces a structured Sumsub configuration plan — mapping each regulatory requirement to the Sumsub entities that satisfy it, with a clear split between what can be configured **now via skills** and what requires the **Sumsub Dashboard**.

This is a **planning skill only**. It produces a text description, never JSON payloads or API calls.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Gather context

Before analyzing, collect:
- **Jurisdiction** — if the document covers multiple countries or is ambiguous, ask explicitly:
  _"This regulation covers [list of countries]. Which jurisdiction should the plan focus on?"_
  Do not generate a plan for all jurisdictions simultaneously without a direct request to do so.
- **Business type** — crypto exchange, neobank, iGaming, fintech, or other. Ask if not clear from the document.
- **Client types** — individuals, companies, or both.
- **Existing Sumsub setup** — has the user already configured anything? Avoid suggesting duplicates.

### Step 2 — Analyze (think before responding)

Use extended thinking before formulating the response. Extract from the document:
- Customer identification requirements (who must be identified, what data is required)
- Acceptable identity documents (national ID, passport, tax number, etc.)
- Address verification requirements (what documents are accepted, maximum age)
- Enhanced Due Diligence conditions (what triggers EDD)
- Source of funds / wealth / PEP data collection requirements
- Transaction monitoring requirements (thresholds, suspicious patterns, crypto Travel Rule)
- Periodic re-KYC obligations (how often customers must be re-verified)
- What is **out of scope for Sumsub** (data retention timelines, regulatory reporting, sanctions list maintenance)

### Step 3 — Validate understanding first

After analysis, present a short **"My Understanding"** block — bullet points of extracted requirements — and ask:
_"Have I understood the key requirements correctly? Anything to add or correct?"_

**Do not generate the full plan until the user confirms.** This is mandatory.

### Step 4 — Generate the plan

Only after user confirmation, produce the full configuration plan using the [output format](#output-format) below.

## Sumsub Capability Map

### A. Verification Levels — `sumsub-create-level`

Defines the sequence of verification steps an applicant must complete. Each step is a `docSet`.

**Available docSet types:**

| Type | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `IDENTITY` | Document verification: PASSPORT, ID_CARD, DRIVERS, RESIDENCE_PERMIT, VOTER_ID, etc. Can be restricted by issuing country. |
| `SELFIE` / `SELFIE2` | Biometrics and liveness. |
| `APPLICANT_DATA` | Personal data collection: full name, date of birth, address, nationality, tax number (TIN/CPF/CNPJ/etc.). |
| `PROOF_OF_RESIDENCE` / `PROOF_OF_RESIDENCE2` | Address document verification. References a PoA preset by `poaStepSettingsId`. |
| `PHONE_VERIFICATION` / `EMAIL_VERIFICATION` | Contact verification via OTP. |
| `QUESTIONNAIRE` / `QUESTIONNAIRE2–4` | Custom form. References a questionnaire definition by `questionnaireDefId`. |
| `E_KYC` | Non-document electronic verification against external databases. See [E-KYC section](#e-kyc-non-document-electronic-verification). |
| `DEVICE_CHECK` | Device intelligence and fingerprinting. Requires `DEVICE_INTELLIGENCE` license. |
| `COMPANY` | KYB: company info collection. |
| `COMPANY_DATA` | KYB: company data fields. |
| `COMPANY_DOCUMENTS` | KYB: corporate documents upload. |
| `COMPANY_BENEFICIARIES` | KYB: UBOs and representatives verification. |
| `ACCREDITED_INVESTOR` | Accredited investor qualification. |
| `E_SIGN` | Electronic signature capture. |
| `TR_RECIPIENT_INFORMATION` | Travel Rule recipient data collection. |

**Level properties:**
- `applicantType`: `individual` or `company`
- `requiredIdDocs`: the ordered list of docSets + optional `includedCountries` / `excludedCountries`
- `watchListCheckSettings`: enables AML/PEP/sanctions screening via watchlists
- `crossCheckPresetId`: cross-check preset for AML screening


#### IDENTITY — document type codes

Sumsub uses generic `IdDocType` values regardless of what the document is locally called. Map the regulation's document names to these types:

| Generic document class | Sumsub `IdDocType` |
|---|---|
| International / biometric passport | `PASSPORT` |
| National identity card (any country) | `ID_CARD` |
| Driver's licence | `DRIVERS` |
| Residence / immigration permit | `RESIDENCE_PERMIT` |
| Voter ID | `VOTER_ID` |
| Documents with no dedicated Sumsub type (e.g. tax cards, social security cards) | `OTHER_DOCS` |

`includedCountries` / `excludedCountries` use ISO-3166 alpha-3 (e.g. `BRA`, `USA`, `DEU`).

Two-sided capture should be specified whenever a mandatory identifier (tax number, national number) appears on the back of the document.

#### SELFIE — liveness options (`videoRequired`)

| Value | Description | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `passiveLiveness` | **Default.** Advanced passive liveness, no movement required. | Standard KYC — no stricter regulatory mandate. |
| `activeLiveness` | Active motion challenge (head movement detection). | Regulation explicitly requires active/dynamic liveness. |
| `enabled` | Short video — applicant pronounces displayed digits. | Regulation requires video identity check. |
| `photoRequired` | Photo-only selfie, no liveness. | Use only when explicitly requested; generally insufficient for AML compliance. |
| `staticLiveness` | Single-frame analysis. | Use only when explicitly requested. |

For most AML/KYC regulations without a specific liveness requirement, default to `passiveLiveness`.

#### APPLICANT_DATA — common field names

Standard personal-data fields:

| Field name | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `firstName` | First / given name |
| `lastName` | Last / family name |
| `dob` | Date of birth |
| `country` | Country of residence (ISO-3166 alpha-3) |
| `town` | City / town |
| `street` | Street address |
| `postCode` | Postal / ZIP code |
| `nationality` | Nationality (ISO-3166 alpha-3) |
| `placeOfBirth` | Place of birth |
| `tin` | Tax identification number (TIN, CPF, SSN, BSN, etc.) |

When a regulation mandates collection of a national tax or identity number, map it to `tin` and mark it `required: true`.

#### DEVICE_CHECK — what it detects

When `DEVICE_INTELLIGENCE` license is active, this step flags: emulators, rooted/jailbroken devices, VPN/proxy/Tor connections, remote-desktop software, and crypto-mixer tools. Always note in the plan that this step silently falls back to disabled if the tenant lacks the entitlement — add a GET-back verification step.

### B. Questionnaires — `sumsub-create-questionnaire`

Custom forms for collecting applicant data not captured by document checks.

**Common use cases:** source of funds, source of wealth, employment, PEP self-declaration, trading experience, risk profile.

**Question types:** `text`, `textArea`, `date`, `dateTime`, `bool`, `select`, `selectDropdown`, `multiSelect`, `phone`, `countrySelect`, `countryMultiSelect`, `fileAttachment`, `multiFileAttachments`.

**Conditional logic:** sections and items can be shown/hidden based on previous answers.

**Risk scoring:** each answer option can carry a `score` (0–100); scores sum automatically and can be referenced in downstream transaction monitoring rules.

### C. Proof of Address Presets — `sumsub-create-poa-preset`

Reusable configuration for what documents are accepted as proof of address.

**Document categories:**
- `governmentOrganization` — government-issued (voter registration, tax bill, etc.)
- `utilityProvider` — utility bills
- `bank` — bank statements and letters
- `mobileOperator` — telecom bills
- `other`

**Key settings:**
- `maxMonths` per category — maximum document age
- **Cross-validation:** name/address comparison between identity document (POI) and address document (POA) — fuzzy or strict mode
- **PoI-as-PoA:** accept the identity document itself as proof of address
- **Neobank blocklist:** exclude documents from specific institutions (Revolut, N26, Wise, etc.)
- **Country-specific overrides:** different rules per country

### D. E-KYC (Non-Document Electronic Verification)

**⚠️ Requires separate activation per country through a Sumsub Customer Success Manager (CSM). License: `E_KYC_TARGET`.**

Configured via `sumsub-create-level` once activated.

**How it works:** the applicant submits unique identifiers (TIN, document number, bank login) which are validated against external databases — no document photo required.

**Two configuration modes:**
1. **Standalone `E_KYC` docSet** — electronic verification only; applicant cannot upload documents instead
2. **`IDENTITY` with `ekycAllowed: true`** — applicant chooses: upload document photo OR complete E-KYC

**Available database types:** `GOVERNMENT` (national registries), `CREDIT` (credit bureaus), `TELCO` (telecom providers), `BANKING`, `COMMERCIAL` (business registries), `CONSUMER`, `UTILITY`, `POSTAL`, `PROPRIETARY`.

**Verification methods:** `ENRICHMENT`, `ONE_X_ONE_MATCHING`, `TWO_X_TWO_MATCHING`, `VALIDITY_CHECK`.

**Configuration rules:**
- Country coverage depends entirely on client's license activations — there is no universal list
- Recommended to pair with a `SELFIE` step for biometric verification against database records

**Activation steps:** (1) contact CSM to request per-country activation, (2) run `sumsub-create-level`.

### E. Transaction Monitoring — KYT Rules

**⚠️ No public skill available yet. Configure manually in Sumsub Dashboard → Settings → Transaction Monitoring.**

Describes what to configure, not how to do it via API.

**Transaction types:**
- `finance` — financial transactions (fiat and crypto)
- `travelRule` — crypto transactions subject to Travel Rule (FATF / VASP)
- `kyc` — KYC-related events
- `userPlatformEvent` — login, signup, password reset, 2FA changes
- `scheduledEvent` — periodic triggers (requires `TM_SCHEDULED_EVENTS` license)

**Rule anatomy:**
- **Condition** — trigger (e.g., "incoming crypto transaction > $10,000")
- **Action:** `score` (add risk points), `onHold` (freeze transaction), `awaitUser` (request confirmation), `reject` (block)
- **Risk score** (0–100) — cumulative; multiple rules sum their scores
- **Applicant change** — move applicant to another level, trigger final rejection, or route to manual review
- **Case creation** — auto-create a compliance investigation case on rule match

**Automated pre-scoring enrichments** (active for licensed tenants):
- AML watchlists (PEP, sanctions, adverse media)
- Crypto screening: Chainalysis, Elliptic, TRM Labs, Merkle Science, Crystal
- Travel Rule processing
- Device intelligence and fingerprinting
- BIN lookup and payment method analytics

**Periodic Re-KYC (Scheduled Rules):**
- Trigger: applicants on level X for N days → reassign to a new level (triggers re-verification)
- Requires `TM_SCHEDULED_EVENTS` license

**Required licenses for TM features:** `KYT`, `TRAVEL_RULE`, `TM_SCHEDULED_EVENTS`, `KYT_ANTI_FRAUD`, `DEVICE_INTELLIGENCE`.

### F. Workflows — `sumsub-create-workflow`

Graph-based routing logic: determines which level an applicant goes through next based on conditions.

**Node types:** `applicantLevel` (run a level), `exclusiveChoice` (condition branch), `manualReview`, `finalRejection`, `actions` (tags, notes, source-key changes).

**Edge conditions:** by applicant country, number of attempts, review decision (approved / rejected / resubmission), custom expressions.

Use when regulation requires risk-based routing (standard KYC for low-risk, EDD for high-risk), re-verification flows, or multi-stage onboarding.

### G. Transaction Submission — `sumsub-create-transaction`

Sends transaction data to Sumsub's KYT monitoring system. Distinct from TM Rules:
- This skill handles **data submission** (what transaction data to send)
- TM Rules define **what to do** with that data (configured in the Dashboard)

Covers: finance transactions, Travel Rule (crypto counterparty data), platform events (login/signup).

## Output Format

Produce the plan as a structured markdown document with two clearly separated sections.

**Critical:** use actual Sumsub enum values and field names throughout — not prose descriptions. Every step must show the concrete parameters that will go into the API call.

3. `sumsub-create-level` (standard KYC level)
4. `sumsub-create-level` (EDD level, if needed)
5. `sumsub-create-workflow` (if risk-based routing needed)
6. `sumsub-create-transaction` (instrument transaction submission)
7. Dashboard — configure TM rules manually
```

---

## Rules

1. **Language:** respond in the same language as the user's request.
2. **Think first:** use extended thinking before formulating the response — regulation texts are dense and requirements are often implicit.
3. **One jurisdiction at a time:** if the document covers multiple jurisdictions, ask which one to plan for before proceeding. Do not produce multi-jurisdiction plans unprompted.
4. **Validate before generating:** after analysis, present the "My Understanding" summary and wait for user confirmation before producing the full plan.
5. **No JSON:** this skill produces text descriptions only. Never generate API payloads, JSON objects, or configuration code.
6. **Be concrete:** the plan must use actual Sumsub parameter names and enum values, not prose descriptions. Write `docTypes: [PASSPORT, ID_CARD, DRIVERS]`, not "Passport and national ID". Write `videoRequired: passiveLiveness`, not "advanced liveness". Write `fields: [firstName, lastName, dob, tin]`, not "name and tax number". Include country codes in ISO-3166 alpha-3 (`BRA`, not "Brazil"). Name questionnaire item types (`bool`, `select`, `text`). Use the country-specific document mapping table in the Capability Map to translate local document names to IdDocType codes.
7. **Mark the boundary clearly:** every item in the plan must be in either ✅ (skills available now) or ⚠️ (Dashboard / skill in development). Never leave the boundary ambiguous.
8. **E-KYC is always opt-in:** always mark E-KYC as requiring CSM activation. List the activation steps. Do not present it as a default option.
9. **TM rules in plain language only:** describe trigger conditions and actions in business language (e.g., "block transactions over $50,000"). Do not write SumScript expressions or technical rule syntax.
10. **No TM rules without explicit requirement:** only include TM rules in the plan if the regulation explicitly requires transaction monitoring.
11. **Licenses:** flag `DEVICE_INTELLIGENCE`, `E_KYC_TARGET`, `KYT`, `TRAVEL_RULE`, `TM_SCHEDULED_EVENTS` as requiring license verification.
12. **Out of scope:** explicitly list requirements the regulation contains that Sumsub cannot fulfill (data retention, authority reporting, etc.).
